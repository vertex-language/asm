// CMP is SUBS with XZR as its destination. MOV is ORR with WZR, or ADD with an
// immediate of zero, depending on the operands. LSL is UBFM. RET is RET X30.
// Each of these is in the ARM ARM's own table with a stated equivalence and a
// stated preferred disassembly, and each is one-to-one: the alias determines
// the word and the word determines whether the alias is preferred.
//
// That one-to-one property is what makes this an alias relation and not
// instruction selection. Emit picks an encoding of the instruction the caller
// named; when the caller names CMP it gets the SUBS word, which is the same
// instruction under another name, not a different instruction chosen for them.
//
// The assembler-invented layer — ldr x0, =value, a MOVZ/MOVK chain for a wide
// constant — is not here and is not an alias. One mnemonic becoming three
// instructions is selection, and a literal pool is layout.

// Barrier is the option field of DMB, DSB and ISB: which accesses the barrier
// orders, and in which direction.
//
// The encoding is two independent halves. Bits 3:2 are the domain — outer
// shareable, non-shareable, inner shareable, full system — and bits 1:0 are
// the access types, load and store. That structure is why the names are not an
// arbitrary list: ISH is inner shareable with both bits set, ISHLD is the same
// domain with loads only, and every legal name is one of the domains crossed
// with one of the three access combinations.

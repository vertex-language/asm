// Multi-byte no-operation sequences, for padding a code section to an
// alignment. Padding .text with 0x00 produces a listing that disassembles
// into garbage, which is why this table exists at all.
//
// There are two tables and the base level chooses between them. The 0F 1F
// multi-byte NOP is available only on processors reporting family 6 or F —
// Pentium Pro and later, which is exactly the i686 level — and raises #UD on
// anything earlier. Below i686 the filler is the lea-based sequence GNU as
// uses, which is architecturally a real instruction with no effect.
//
// This is the reason Align takes a feature set rather than being a constant
// table: at --features i486 the P6 sequence is not a slower nop, it is an
// illegal instruction.

// p6Nops is Intel SDM Vol. 2, Table 4-12, indexed by length.
